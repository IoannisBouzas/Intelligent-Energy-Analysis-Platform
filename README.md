# Intelligent-Energy-Analysis-Platform

A comprehensive AI-powered platform for energy data analysis, market insights, and forecasting with specialized focus on the Greek energy market.

## Overview

This project is part of my summer Intership(2025) at CERTH where i had the chance to built an intelligent assistant that combines multiple specialized tools to provide comprehensive energy analysis capabilities. Built with a modular architecture, it offers data analysis, time-series forecasting, live price monitoring, news analysis, and bill processing in one integrated platform.

- **Live Price Tool**: Real-time Greek energy market price scraping and comparison
- **News Analysis Tool**: Greek energy news aggregation and insight generation
- **Bill Analysis Tool**: OCR-based electricity bill processing and analysis (not yet intergraded)

### üìä **Interactive Dashboard**
- Streamlit-based web interface with real-time data visualization
- Conversational AI chat interface for natural language queries
- Dynamic provider comparison carousel
- Integrated plotting and statistical outputs

### üá¨üá∑ **Greek Energy Market Specialization**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for Chronos forecasting)

### Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Intelligent-Energy-Analysis-Platform.git
cd CircuitImageAi
```

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with required API keys:

```bash
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
streamlit run ui.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the web interface.

### Core Workflows

#### 1. Data Analysis
- Upload CSV/Excel energy datasets
- Ask natural language questions about your data
- Receive automated analysis with visualizations and insights

#### 2. Energy Price Monitoring
- Click "Load Live Prices" in sidebar for real-time Greek energy rates
- Ask comparative questions like "Which provider has the cheapest rates?"
- Get detailed market analysis and savings calculations

#### 3. Time-Series Forecasting
- Upload time-series energy data
- Request predictions: "Forecast energy consumption for next 24 hours"
- Receive probabilistic forecasts with confidence intervals

#### 4. News Analysis
- Query Greek energy news: "Latest news about renewable energy in Greece"
- Get summarized insights from multiple Greek news sources
- Receive market intelligence and trend analysis

### Example Queries

**Data Analysis:**
- "Show me the correlation between temperature and energy consumption"
- "Create a monthly trend analysis of electricity usage"
- "What are the peak consumption hours in my dataset?"

**Price Comparison:**
- "Which energy provider offers the best rates for high consumption?"
- "Compare all providers for usage under 2000 kWh"
- "Show me potential annual savings by switching providers"

**Forecasting:**
- "Predict energy demand for the next week"
- "Forecast solar generation for tomorrow"
- "What will be the consumption trend for next month?"

**News Intelligence:**
- "Latest developments in Greek energy policy"
- "Recent news about electricity prices in Greece"
- "Updates on renewable energy projects"
